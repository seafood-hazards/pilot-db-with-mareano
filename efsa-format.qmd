## Report on Trace Elements {#efsa-report}

The details of EFSA submission and their objectives are described in this [call](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/call/call-data-determination-natural-background-concentrations-trace-elements-co-cu-i-mn-mo-se-or) from EFSA.

*   **Data on** natural background concentrations of trace elements (cobalt, copper, iodine, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc)
*   **Trace element concentrations** in marine sediment along the coasts of EU, EFTA, and EU candidate countries (including fjords and estuaries)
*   **Samples collected** within the last 15 years (2009 to present)
*   **Samples from** pristine areas (defined as areas unaffected by point or diffuse pollution sources)
*   **Supporting metadata** regarding porewater pH, sediment texture (% clay <2 µm, % silt 2–63 µm, % sand >63 µm), and organic matter content (%)
